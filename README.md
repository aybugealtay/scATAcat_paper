### Code for the scATAcat Manuscript

The provided code reproduces the figures presented in the manuscript. To enhance accessibility, the code and notebooks are organized into the following structure:

- **Preprocessing**
    - Obtaining ENCODE cCRE coverages of all the datasets
    - Doublet detection for single-cell (PBMC) dataset
    - Generating synthetic bulk dataset for fesibility study
    - Differential accesibility analysis for the prototype bulk ATAC-seq samples
      
- **Notebooks**
    - Notebooks to reproduce figures in the manuscript
    -  For each dataset, notebooks include scripts to apply:
        - scATAcat
        - Marker-based annotation
        - Seurat label-transfer
    - Notebooks reproducing Supplementary tables
      
- **Results**
    - Figures and output files resulting from the notebook runs
   
- **Data**
